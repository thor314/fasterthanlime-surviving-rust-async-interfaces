    // where before, we were required R: Unpin to write:
    // let mut boxed = Box::new(&mut self.get_mut().inner);
    // let inner: Pin<&mut Box<&mut R>> = Pin::new(&mut boxed);
    // inner.poll_read(cx, buf)

    // We now can write TF, without R: Unpin. `project` takes a Pin<&mut Self> to get a &mut T for
    // unpinned fields, and a Pin<&mut T> for pinned fields. The following inner will then be
    // pinned by project?
    let inner: Pin<&mut R> = self.project().inner; // ðŸ˜Ž nice
    inner.poll_read(cx, buf)
    // this has the additional benefit that we can't accidentally Unpin something that really
    // *should* be pinned while polling it.
  }
}

// now what if we want to make our own async trait interfaces? Gotta import tha async_trait crate,
// since GATs are still pretty recent. Go to mod my_async_trait.
